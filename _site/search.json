The course introduces students to the essential tools for conducting data-driven research, including the fundamentals of programming techniques and the essentials of statistics. Students will work with real-world datasets from various domains; write computer code to manipulate, explore, and analyze data; use basic techniques from statistics and machine learning to analyze data; learn to draw conclusions using sound statistical reasoning; and produce scientific reports. No prior knowledge of programming or statistics is required."

    "text": "Cooperative Classroom\nLearning in a cooperative environment should be stimulating, demanding, and fair. Because this approach to learning is different from the competitive classroom structure that many other courses used to be based on, it is important for us to be clear about mutual expectations. Below are my expectations for students in this class. This set of expectations is intended to maximize debate and exchange of ideas in an atmosphere of mutual respect while preserving individual ownership of ideas and written words. If you feel you do not understand or cannot agree to these expectations, you should discuss this with your instructor and classmates.\n\nStudents are expected to work cooperatively with other members of the class and show respect for the ideas and contributions of other people.\nWhen working as part of a group, students should strive to be good contributors to the group, listen to others, not dominate, and recognize the contributions of others. Students should try to ensure that everyone in the group is welcome to contribute and recognize that everyone contributes in different ways to a group process.\nStudents should explore data, make observations, and develop inferences as part of a group. If you use material from published sources, you must provide appropriate attribution.\n\n\n\n(Students will be asked to acknowledge this document in an online form.)\nThis document has been adapted from Scientific Teaching by Jo Handelsman, Sarah Miller, and Christine Pfund\n\n\n\n\nScientific Teaching"

Hadley Wickham—the chief data scientist at RStudio and the author of some amazing R packages you will be using like ggplot2—made this wise observation:\n\n\n\n\n\n\nWisdom from Hadley Wickham\n\n\n\n\n\nIt’s easy when you start out programming to get really frustrated and think, “Oh it’s me, I’m really stupid,” or, “I’m not made out to program.” But, that is absolutely not the case. Everyone gets frustrated. I still get frustrated occasionally when writing R code. It’s just a natural part of programming. So, it happens to everyone and gets less and less over time. Don’t blame yourself. Just take a break, do something fun, and then come back and try again later.\n\n\n\nIf you are finding yourself taking way too long hitting your head against a wall and not understanding, take a break, talk to classmates, ask questions … e-mail [Derek], etc. I promise you can do this.\n—Andrew Heiss, Georgia State University"
