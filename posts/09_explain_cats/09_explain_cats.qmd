## Scenario

"Company wants to automate the loan eligibility process (real time) based on customer detail provided while filling online application form. These details are Gender, Marital Status, Education, Number of Dependents, Income, Loan Amount, Credit History and others. To automate this process, they have given a problem to identify the customers segments, those are eligible for loan amount so that they can specifically target these customers. Here they have provided a partial data set."

## Response Variable

We will try to predict the loan amount (i.e. numerical variable)

* Loan amount (in thousands of dollars)

## Explanatory Variables

* Gender (of primary applicant)
* Marital status (of primary applicant)
* Dependents 
* Education
* Self-employed
* Applicant income (monthly, in dollars)
* Co-applicant income (monthly, in dollars)
* loan amount terms (in months)
* Credit history
* Property area

:::::

## Cleaning

* remove rows that have missing values in the response variable (`loan_amount`)
* convert `dependents` to a numerical variable

    * here, replace "+" with nothing

* combine "income" columns

    * ensure all dollar amounts are in the same units (thousands of dollars)

* convert `credit_history` to a factor variable (i.e. categorical)

* retain relevant columns

```{r}
loan_df <- loan_df |>
  filter(!is.na(loan_amount)) |>
  mutate(dependents_num = as.numeric(
    str_replace(dependents, "\\+", "")
  )) |>
  mutate(income = applicant_income/1000 + coapplicant_income/1000) |>
  mutate(credit_history = factor(credit_history)) |>
  select(loan_amount, income, dependents_num, gender, married, education, self_employed, credit_history, property_area, loan_status)
```

After cleaning the data, we should report the size of the resultant data frame

```{r}
nrow(loan_df) #number of observations
ncol(loan_df) #number of variables
```

and the structure of the data frame.

```{r}
str(loan_df, give.attr = FALSE)
```


# Multiple Linear Regression

## Scenario 1:

* response variable: `loan_amount`
* explanatory variables:

    * `income`
    * `dependents_num`

## Build the Model
    
```{r}
mod1 <- lm(loan_amount ~ income + dependents_num, data = loan_df)
```

## Interpretation

Sometimes we interpret the slopes to see if the found coefficients make sense in context.

```{r}
mod1
```

> Holding dependents constant, for each $1000 increase in monthly income, the loan amount increases by about $8000

> Holding income constant, for each additional dependent, the loan amount increases by about $7000

::: {.callout-tip collapse="true"}
## Intercept

Can you interpret the intercept value too?  Does that make sense to you?
:::


## Determination

```{r}
summary(mod1)$adj.r.squared
```

> For this baseline model, the coefficient of determination states that we can explain about 40 percent of the variance in loan amount with these two numerical explanatory variables.


# Categorical Input

Let us expand the model to include `credit_history`.

$$\text{Credit History} = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{passed credit check} \\
0, & \text{did not pass credit check} \\ \end{cases}$$

We are treating this variable as *categorical*.

## Scatterplot

```{r}
loan_df |>
  filter(!is.na(credit_history)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = income, y = loan_amount, color = credit_history)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm",
              se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Dream Home Finance",
       subtitle = "Interaction Plot",
       caption = "SML 201",
       x = "combined monthly income (thousands)",
       y = "loan amount (thousands)") +
  theme_minimal()
```

## Model 2

```{r}
mod2_without_interaction <- lm(loan_amount ~ income + 
                                 dependents_num +
                                 credit_history,
                               data = loan_df)
```

## Model Statistics

```{r}
summary(mod2_without_interaction)

## Interpretation

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
Y & = & \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2} + \beta_{3}X_{1}X_{3} \\
~ & \approx & 81.7427 + 6.4019X_{1} + 9.3093X_{2} + 1.9206X_{3}
\end{array}$$

where

$$X_{1}: \text{income}, \quad X_{2}: \text{number of dependents}$$

and

$$X_{3} = \begin{cases} 1, & \text{passed credit check} \\
0, & \text{did not pass credit check} \\ \end{cases}$$

> Passing the credit check increases the home loan by about $2000 (??)

# Interaction Term

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
Y & = & \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2} + \beta_{3}X_{1}X_{3} \\
\end{array}$$

```{r}
mod2_with_interaction <- lm(loan_amount ~ income +
                              dependents_num +
                              income:credit_history,
                            data = loan_df)
```

## Refined Interpretation

```{r}
summary(mod2_with_interaction)
```

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
Y & = & \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2} + \beta_{3}X_{1}X_{3} \\
~ & = & 81.7427 + 6.4019X_{1} + 9.3093X_{2} + 1.9206X_{1}X_{3} \\
\end{array}$$

* For a family with $X_{2} = 0$ dependents and bad credit history ($X_{3} = 0$)

$$Y = 81.7427 + 6.4019X_{1}$$

> For each $1000 increase in monthly income, the loan amount increases by about $6400.

* For a family with $X_{2} = 0$ dependents and good credit history ($X_{3} = 1$)

$$Y = 81.7427 + 6.4019X_{1} + 1.9206X_{1}$$

> For each $1000 increase in monthly income, the loan amount increases by about $8300.

::: {.callout-warning}
## DCP2

## Determination

```{r}
summary(mod2_with_interaction)$adj.r.squared
```

> For this model with an interaction term and the two original explanatory variables, the coefficient of determination shows that we can explain about 40 percent of the variance in the loan amount.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## How Complex Should Models Be?

Did you catch that?

* `mod1` had a coefficient of determination of about 0.3955
* `mod2_with_interaction` had a coefficient of determination of about 0.3957

With hardly any gains in explaning variance, an analyst might opt to continue with the *simpler model* (here: `mod1`) moving forward in an analysis since it eases *interpretability*

## Refined Interpretation

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
Y & = & \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2} + \beta_{3}X_{1}X_{3} \\
~ & = & 87.3028 + 7.9834X_{1} + 7.1590X_{2} - 2.3047X_{1}X_{3} \\
\end{array}$$

* For a family with $X_{2} = 2$ dependents and graduated from college ($X_{3} = 0$)

$$Y = 87.3028 + 7.9834X_{1} + 14.3180$$

> For each $1000 increase in monthly income, the loan amount increases by about $8000.

* For a family with $X_{2} = 2$ dependents and did not graduate from college ($X_{3} = 1$)

$$Y = 81.7427 + 7.9834X_{1} + 14.3180 - 2.3047X_{1}$$

> For each $1000 increase in monthly income, the loan amount increases by about $5600.


## Determination

```{r}
summary(mod3_with_interaction)$adj.r.squared
```

> For this model with an interaction term and the two original explanatory variables, the coefficient of determination shows that we can explain about 40 percent of the variance in the loan amount.

::: {.callout-note collapse="true"}
## Reordering Factors

You may have noticed that `R` tends to output categorical variables in alphabetical order by default (e.g. the bars in a bar chart).  If you want to customize the order presented, you would need to employ a **factor** variable where you can explicitly set the **levels**.

```{r}
loan_df <- loan_df |>
  mutate(education_fac = 
           factor(education,
                  levels = c("Not Graduate", "Graduate")))
```

Now, the software will treat "Not Graduate" as the baseline and "Graduate" as the augmentation.

```{r}
mod4 <- lm(loan_amount ~ income + dependents_num + 
             education_fac,
           data = loan_df)
summary(mod4)
```

```{r}
loan_df |>
  filter(!is.na(education_fac)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = income, y = loan_amount, color = education_fac)) +
  geom_point(alpha = 0.5) +
  geom_smooth(formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm",
              se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Dream Home Finance",
       subtitle = "Parallel Slopes?",
       caption = "SML 201",
       x = "combined monthly income (thousands)",
       y = "loan amount (thousands)") +
  scale_color_manual(values = c("gray", "#E77500")) +
  theme_minimal()
```

:::


# Multiple Categories

What if our categorical variable has *more than two* labels?  Here, let us explore the `property_area` categorical variable.

```{r}
table(loan_df$property_area)
```

```{r}
loan_df |>
  filter(!is.na(property_area)) |>
  ggplot(aes(x = income, y = loan_amount, color = property_area)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(formula = "y ~ x",
              method = "lm",
              se = FALSE) +
  labs(title = "Dream Home Finance",
       subtitle = "Parallel Slopes?",
       caption = "SML 201",
       x = "combined monthly income (thousands)",
       y = "loan amount (thousands)") +
  theme_minimal()
```


## Label Encoding

::: {.callout-warning}
### Labeller in practice

*Caution*: Label encoding is usually not recommended in general.  I include this section here for posterity.
:::

```{r}
set.seed(1337)
loan_df |>
  mutate(property_type = case_when(
    property_area == "Rural" ~ 0,
    property_area == "Semiurban" ~ 1,
    property_area == "Urban" ~ 2,
    TRUE ~ -1
  )) |>
  select(property_area, property_type) |>
  sample_n(size = 10, replace = FALSE)
```

::: {.callout-tip}
## Numerical?

Could we then use `property_type` in a regression model?
:::

::: {.callout-warning}
## Ordinal

*Caution*: Label encoding here implied ranking

* *order*: "Rural", then "Semiurban", then "Urban"
* *proportions*: Is "Urban" (with a coefficient of 2) twice as valuable as "Semiurban"?
:::


## One-Hot Encoding

Similar to previous calculations, our `R` software employs **dummy variables** or **one-hot encoding** to represent categories as ones and zeroes.

```{r}
set.seed(1337)
loan_df |>
  mutate(rural_bool = ifelse(property_area == "Rural", 1, 0),
         semiu_bool = ifelse(property_area == "Semiurban", 1, 0),
         urban_bool = ifelse(property_area == "Urban", 1, 0)) |>
  select(property_area, rural_bool, semiu_bool, urban_bool) |>
  sample_n(size = 10, replace = FALSE)
```

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
Y & = & \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2} + \beta_{3}X_{3} + \beta_{4}X_{4} \\
\end{array}$$

where

$$X_{1}: \text{income}, \quad X_{2}: \text{number of dependents}$$

and

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
  X_{3} & = & \begin{cases} 1, \text{semiurban area} \\ 0, \text{otherwise} \\ \end{cases} \\
  X_{4} & = & \begin{cases} 1, \text{urban area} \\ 0, \text{otherwise} \\ \end{cases} \\
\end{array}$$

## Model 5

```{r}
mod5 <- lm(loan_amount ~ income + 
             dependents_num +
             property_area,
           data = loan_df)
```

## Model Statistics

```{r}
summary(mod5)
```

## Interpretation

$$\begin{array}{rcl}
Y & = & \beta_{0} + \beta_{1}X_{1} + \beta_{2}X_{2} + \beta_{3}X_{3} + \beta_{4}X_{4} \\
~ & = & 89.1639 + 8.0575X_{1} + 6.9669X_{2} - 3.3175X_{3} - 10.8084X_{4} \\
\end{array}$$

For a family with one dependent ($X_{2} = 1$) and a combined monthly income of \$5000 ($X_{1} = 5$),

* if they are seeking a home in a *rural* area ($X_{3} = 0, X_{4} = 0$), the loan amount is predicted to be about 136 thousand
* if they are seeking a home in a *semi-urban* area ($X_{3} = 1, X_{4} = 0$), the loan amount is predicted to be about 133 thousand (i.e. 3 thousand less than the baseline rural  scenario)
* if they are seeking a home in an *urban* area ($X_{3} = 0, X_{4} = 1$), the loan amount is predicted to be about 126 thousand (i.e. 10 thousand less than the baseline rural scenario)
